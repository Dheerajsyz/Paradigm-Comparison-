## Example Output

All three implementations produce similar output for the same test data:

```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]
Mean: 3.57
Median: 4.00
Mode: 5 (frequency: 3)

Array: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
Mean: 2.00
Median: 2.00
Mode: [1, 2, 3] (frequency: 2 each)
```

## Test Cases

Each implementation includes the same comprehensive test cases:

1. **Normal case**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]` - Single mode
2. **Multiple modes**: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]` - All values equally frequent
3. **Single element**: `[42]` - Edge case with one value
4. **Even count**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` - Tests median calculation for even-length lists
5. **Empty array**: `[]` - Edge case handling
